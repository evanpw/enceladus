* Values of type Int or Bool are tagged, meaning that the least-significant bit
  is always set to 1, in order to distinguish these types from pointers at
  run-time (useful for polymorphic functions). All pointers, on the other hand,
  should have the two least-significant bits set to 0 (i.e., they should be
  divisible by 4), which is true at least for the gcc implementation of malloc.

* True = 11b, False = 01b
