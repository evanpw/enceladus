* Mismatches in expected and actual type parameters to a type constructor result
  in an assert error rather than a semantic-analysis error
  (see constructorMismatch.spl)

* It should be enforced that all paths through a function return a value
  (see noReturn.spl)

* Type inference should not be able to make type variables which are explicitly
  specified in the function declaration concrete (see overrideType.spl)
