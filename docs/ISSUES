* Type errors should be more informative

* The distinction between expressions and statements is unnecessary

* Type annotations on function definitions should be optional
  (see optionalAnnotation.spl)

* If/else statements should be allowed to live on one line (see oneLineIf.spl)

* Allow pattern-matching let statement to be an expression by adding an "in"
  clause (see matchExpression.spl)

* Struct members names should be allowed to clash when there is no ambiguity
  Don't try to infer type of structs when accessing a member.
  (see structMemberNames.spl)

* Allow sum types and multiple pattern matching (see sumTypes.spl)
