* Mismatches in expected and actual type parameters to a type constructor result
  in an assert error rather than a semantic-analysis error

* Trailing -> Unit in function definitions should be optional

* Syntax errors should give line and column numbers

* Line numbers in semantic errors should work correctly when importing other
  files

* Comparisons should return something other than an Int (like a special Ordering
  type), they should be a part of the standard library, they should be easier to
  create, and the comparison operators should call them

* It should be enforced that all paths through a function return a value

* Make it possible to detect EOF when reading stdin through a pipe
