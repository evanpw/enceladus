Types survive into the IR, but not the symbol table.

Function:
* List of basic blocks
* Pointer to first basic block

BasicBlock
* Pointer to the enclosing function
* List of instructions
* Must end with a branch or a return

Instruction
* Pointer to the enclosing basic block
* Conditional branches specify both true and false branches
* Target of a conditional branch is a basic block
* Subclasses for each instruction type

Value
* Subclasses: BasicBlock, Instruction(?), Constant, Argument
* Can have a name (local variable), or not (temporary)

Constant
* Subclasses: GlobalValue (function, global variable), ConstantInt
