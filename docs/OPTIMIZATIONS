* Branch (conditional or unconditional) to a block whose only entry is an unconditional jump:
    rewrite destination as destination of unconditional jump

* Conditional branch with constant condition: unconditional jump or delete

* Two blocks with first's only successor = second and second's only predecessor = first: merge

* Keep intermediate calculations as untagged? Maybe add tag / untag instructions to keep track
