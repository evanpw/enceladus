Objectives
--
* Not object-oriented
* Compiled to (bad) x86 (Intel-style) assembly language
* Turing-complete
* No syntactic sugar - syntax as simple as possible
* Only type is integer (equivalent of C's int) - booleans are zero/non-zero

Syntax
--
* No multi-line comments - #-style line comments only
* Only logical operator is "not" - and is simulated by nesting if statements
* Commands are newline-terminated
* Commands: if (no else, use goto instead), then, goto, print, read
* Only comparison operators: >, =
* Operators: +, -, *, / (no unary minus)
* Assignment operator: <-
* Identifiers consist of letters, numbers, and underscores; must begin with a letter
* First use of a variable declares it; all variables are at global scope
* Variables are always initialized to zero
* Parentheses for grouping
* Integers literals cannot have leading zeros

Statements
--
* A program consists of a sequence of lines, separated by newlines
* A line is either empty, a statement, or a label
* Statements are either: if, goto, print, read, or assignment

Operators
--
* Operator precedence:
1) * /
2) + -
3) > =
4) not

* Operator associativity:
1) * / (left)
2) + - (left)
3) > = (left)
4) not (not associative)

* Note: not not (a > b) is not a valid expression - not cannot be repeated

* Note: a > b > c is a valid expression, and is the same as (a > b) > c, where a > b returns a 0 or 1 (boolean), which is then compared as an integer to the value of c
